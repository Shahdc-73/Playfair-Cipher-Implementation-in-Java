# Playfair-Cipher-Implementation-in-Java
This repository contains a Java implementation of the Playfair cipher algorithm, a classical symmetric encryption technique used for encrypting alphabetic text. The Playfair cipher operates on pairs of letters, replacing them with other pairs according to a key matrix.

Features:

Encryption and Decryption: Provides methods to encrypt and decrypt plaintext messages using the Playfair cipher.
Key Generation: Generates a key matrix based on a given keyword, following the Playfair cipher rules.
Text Preprocessing: Handles text preprocessing tasks such as removing non-alphabetic characters and adjusting plaintext for encryption.
Customization: Allows customization of the algorithm parameters such as key length and handling of specific edge cases.
Example Usage: Includes examples demonstrating how to use the Playfair cipher implementation in Java.
Usage:

To use the Playfair cipher in your Java project, simply clone this repository and import the PlayfairCipher class into your project. You can then utilize the provided methods to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Playfair algorithm.
